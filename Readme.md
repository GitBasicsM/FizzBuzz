# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

This Java program is known as the "FizzBuzz" project, a popular coding exercise often used in programming interviews and educational settings. The objective is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but with a twist:

- For numbers **divisible by 3**, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- For numbers **divisible by 5**, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
- For numbers **divisible by both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"` instead of the number.
- For all other numbers, just print the number itself.
